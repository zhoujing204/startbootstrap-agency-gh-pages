# Landing Page Project

This is a landing page project for showcasing a product or service. The landing page is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Features

- Responsive design that works on all devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
- Navigation menu that dynamically highlights the active section.
- Smooth scrolling effect when clicking on the navigation links.
- Section scrolling effect that highlights the active section in the viewport.
- Back-to-top button that appears when scrolling down the page.
- Accessibility features, including ARIA attributes and semantic HTML.

## Getting Started

To get started with the landing page project, you can download or clone the repository from GitHub. You can then open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the landing page.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/landing-page-project.git
```

## Usage

The landing page can be used as a template for showcasing your own product or service. You can modify the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files to customize the landing page to your needs.

The HTML file (`index.html`) contains the structure of the landing page, including the header, navigation menu, sections and footer. You can modify the content of each section to highlight the features of your own product or service.

The CSS file (`styles.css`) contains the styles for the landing page, including the layout, typography and colors. You can modify the styles to match your own brand or design.

The JavaScript file (`app.js`) contains the logic for the navigation menu, section scrolling effect and back-to-top button. You can modify the JavaScript code to add or remove features as needed.
